# Flask-app
In a Flask web application, users can interact with forms to input data such as their name, email, or other information. By using Flask's built-in WTForms, developers can define form fields and handle data submission. After the user submits the form, the input is processed by Flask and can be displayed back to the user, or stored for further use. This process involves creating form classes, defining routes for displaying the form and handling POST requests, and then rendering the form fields on the webpage.
